### Mini Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Midterm Data Science Project

Welcome to my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for a school course project. This analysis is based on the [Students Grading Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudelhemaly/students-grading-dataset).

#### Objectives of the EDA:
1. **Data Overview**: Load and provide a summary of the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
    - Handle missing data.
    - Identify and remove duplicate rows.
    - Correct inconsistencies in gender values.
    - Drop irrelevant columns.
    - Standardize categorical values.
    - Detect and address outliers.
3. **Data Visualization and Analysis**:
    - Explore the relationship between **Study_Hours_per_Week** and other features.
    - Answer key questions:
        - How do study hours per week influence academic performance (attendance, midterm, final, quiz, and project scores)?
        - What is the impact of study hours on physical well-being (stress levels and sleep hours per night)?
        - Are there differences in weekly study hours among students based on factors like Department, Family Income Level, Parent Education Level, Extracurricular Activities, and Internet Access at Home?
        - What is the optimal number of study hours per week for achieving high academic results?

This project aims to uncover insights that can help students optimize their study habits and improve academic outcomes.
